## Context and Problem Statement
In our current architecture, Python-based microservices will communicate with each other using the MQTT protocol. To ensure consistent event formatting, interoperability, and to leverage existing tooling, we need to adopt a standardized event specification. The primary options considered are CloudEvents, AsyncAPI, and developing a custom event specification.

## Considered Options

* **CloudEvents**
* **AsyncAPI**
* **Custom Event Specification**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **CloudEvents**, because it provides a lightweight, standardized format for event data with broad industry support, and offers a Python SDK under the Apache 2.0 license, facilitating seamless integration into our existing Python microservices architecture over MQTT.

### Consequences

* **Positive:**
  - **Interoperability:** Adopting CloudEvents ensures our services can easily interoperate with other systems adhering to the same standard
  - **Tooling Support:** The availability of a Python SDK simplifies development and integration efforts
  - **Simplicity:** CloudEvents' focus on event data structure without prescribing transport protocols aligns with our MQTT-based communication

* **Negative:**
  - **Learning Curve:** Developers will need to familiarize themselves with the CloudEvents specification and its Python SDK
  - **Customization Limitations:** While CloudEvents is flexible, it may not cover every specific use case without extensionsÓàÜ

## Code Samples

### Example CloudEvent

```json
{
    "attributes": {
        "type": "autopatch.crashdetail",
        "source": "autopatch.fuzzing-service",
        "specversion": "1.0",
        "id": "24c281a9-37e0-4574-8ac3-d5f64f4e7d13",
        "time": "2025-02-25T17:54:46.161479+00:00"
    },
    "data": {
        "executable_name": "complex3",
        "base64_message": "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=",
        "is_input_from_file" : false
    }
}
```

### Example Python for creating a CloudEvent

```python
from cloudevents.conversion import to_binary
from cloudevents.conversion import to_structured
from cloudevents.http import CloudEvent

# Create a CloudEvent
# - The CloudEvent "id" is generated if omitted. "specversion" defaults to "1.0".
attributes = {
    "type": "autopatch.crashdeetail",
    "source": "autopatch.fuzzing-service",
}

data = {"message": "Hello World!"}
event = CloudEvent(attributes, data)
print("Event:", event)

# Creates the HTTP request representation of the CloudEvent in structured content mode
headers, body = to_structured(event)
print(f"Headers: {headers}")
print(f"Body: {body}")


# POST
# requests.post("<some-url>", data=body, headers=headers)
```

## Comparison of Options

### CloudEvents
CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in a common format to provide interoperability across services, platforms, and systems. It focuses on the structure of event data, allowing for consistent processing regardless of the underlying transport protocol. The CloudEvents project offers a Python SDK licensed under Apache 2.0, which facilitates integration into Python applications

**Pros:**
- **Standardization:** Provides a consistent structure for event data, enhancing interoperability
- **Lightweight:** Focuses solely on the event data structure without imposing constraints on transport protocols
- **Python SDK:** Availability of an officially supported Python SDK under Apache 2.0 license simplifies development

**Cons:**
- **Limited Protocol Specifications:** Does not define how events should be transmitted over specific protocols like MQTT, requiring additional implementation details

### AsyncAPI
AsyncAPI is a specification for defining asynchronous APIs, particularly suited for event-driven architectures. It provides a comprehensive framework for describing the interface of message-driven systems, including details about message formats, channels, and servers. AsyncAPI is protocol-agnostic and supports various protocols, including MQTT.

> [!NOTE]  
> AsyncAPI is protocol-agnostic and supports various protocols, including MQTT and CloudEvents.  Making it forward compatible with autopatch

**Pros:**
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Defines not only the message structure but also the communication channels and server configurations
- **Protocol Agnostic:** Supports multiple protocols, including MQTT, making it versatile for different architectures
- **Tooling Ecosystem:** Offers tools for documentation generation, code generation, and validation

**Cons:**
- **Complexity:** The extensive scope of AsyncAPI may introduce unnecessary complexity for projects that require only event data standardization
- **Learning Curve:** Developers need to grasp the full specification to utilize its benefits effectively

### Custom Event Specification
Developing a custom event specification involves creating a tailored format and structure for event data specific to our application's needs

**Pros:**
- **Tailored Solution:** Can be designed to meet specific requirements and constraints of our system
- **Full Control:** Allows complete control over the event structure and implementation

**Cons:**
- **Resource Intensive:** Requires significant effort to design, implement, and maintain
- **Lack of Standardization:** May lead to interoperability challenges with external systems
- **Tooling Deficiency:** Would lack the rich tooling ecosystem available with established standards like CloudEvents and AsyncAPI

## Conclusion
While AsyncAPI offers a robust framework for defining asynchronous APIs, its comprehensive nature may introduce unnecessary complexity for our use case, which focuses on standardizing event data between Python microservices over MQTT. Developing a custom event specification provides flexibility but at the cost of increased development and maintenance efforts, CloudEvents strikes a balance by offering a standardized, lightweight event data format with an available Python SDK, making it a pragmatic choice for our architecture.
