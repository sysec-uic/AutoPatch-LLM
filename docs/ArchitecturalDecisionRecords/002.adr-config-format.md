## Context and Problem Statement
This record documents the architectural decision regarding the configuration format for our service, specifically comparing JSON and YAML parsing in Python. The evaluation focuses on library support, licensing, and overall maintainability.

## Considered Options

### YAML Parsing
- **Pros:**  
  - YAML is widely appreciated for its human-readable syntax and flexibility.
- **Cons:**  
  - Reliable YAML parsing in Python typically requires third-party libraries such as PyYaml.
  - The current PyYaml repository lacks a LICENSE, raising potential legal and compliance issues.

### JSON Parsing
- **Pros:**  
  - JSON parsing is natively supported by the Python standard library using tools like `dataclasses`.
  - This approach minimizes external dependencies, enhancing stability and maintainability.
- **Cons:**  
  - JSON is generally less expressive and less human-friendly compared to YAML for configuration files.

## Decision Outcome
After careful evaluation, the decision is to adopt **JSON** as the configuration format. This choice is based on:
- The built-in support in the Python standard library, which reduces reliance on external libraries.
- The absence of licensing issues that affect YAML parsing libraries like PyYaml.
- A focus on long-term maintainability and legal clarity.

## Consequences
- **Positive Consequences:**
  - **Simplicity and Stability:** Leveraging Python‚Äôs native JSON support simplifies development and reduces potential security risks.
  - **Legal Safety:** Eliminates concerns related to third-party licensing, ensuring full compliance.
- **Negative Consequences:**
  - **User Experience:** The configuration files will be less human-readable than YAML, which might impact ease-of-use for manual edits.
  - **Flexibility:** The decision may limit future adaptability if a robust, properly licensed YAML parser emerges, potentially requiring a reevaluation of the chosen format.

## Future Considerations
- **Monitoring Developments:** Keep track of advancements in the YAML ecosystem, especially regarding licensing and library improvements.
- **Reevaluation:** Consider revisiting the decision if a secure and licensed YAML solution becomes viable, enabling support for both JSON and YAML formats.
