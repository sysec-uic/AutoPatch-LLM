## Context and Problem Statement

We need a way for processes to communicate with each other that is scalable and supports async.  

## Considered Options

* MQTT with mosquitto
* Google Pub/Sub

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MQTT with mosquitto", because mosquitto can run easily with minimal configuration as a container.   MQTT is a lightweight pub/sub messaging protocol that is easy to implement and suitable for low powered devices. MQTT also has a python SDK paho.mqtt with permissive open source licensing, which resolves our need for a simple message broker.

### Consequences

* Good, because be can pass CloudEvents that marshall to domain context objects
* Bad, because we need to maintain another container 

## Future Considerations

- **Monitoring Trends:**  
  - the mosquitto broker may need runtime monitoring and observability with scale, Telegraph InfluxDB and Graphana are potential tools to consider along with Google Cloud tools
  
- **Adaptability:**  
  - Evaluate opportunities for integrating new tools or methodologies that may improve the current solution.
  - We should design our facade to easily support swapping to a cloud service like Google Pub/Sub if future scale requirements apply.
  
- **Potential Improvements:**  
  - Identify areas where the current approach might be enhanced or optimized.
  
- **Contingency Plans:**  
  - data output via CSV
