## ADR Status
- [ ] ADR under construction 🚧
- [ ] In Review ⏳
- [x] Accepted ✅
- [ ] Rejected ❌

## Context and Problem Statement

The existing fuzzing infrastructure uses AFL2.52b, which has now been officially archived and is no longer actively maintained. This poses a long-term risk in terms of support and compatibility. Hence, we need to evaluate a transition to a better alternative while ensuring its technically feasibility and seamless integration with our existing fuzzing setup. 

## Considered Options

* Upgrading to AFL++  
* Switching to an alternative fuzzer  
* Integrating with FuzzBench for evaluation

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Upgrade to AFL++**, because it is an actively maintained and modern version of AFL that supports existing workflows, makes migration easy, and offers enhanced features with community support.


### Consequences

* **Positive:**
  - **Active Maintenance:** AFL++ is under active development, with continued bug fixes, improvements, and documentation.
  - **Seamless Transition:** Minimal changes are required for compilation and execution, as verified by a technical spike using AFL training examples.
  - **Modern Features:** AFL++ introduces modern fuzzing capabilities like persistent mode, better instrumentation, and stability improvements.
  - **Package Availability:** The `afl` package on Ubuntu now installs AFL++ by default, simplifying installation steps.

* **Negative:**
  - **Tooling Adjustments:** Requires updating build scripts to use `afl-clang-fast` or similar AFL++ compilers instead of `afl-gcc`.
  - **Integration Updates:** Internal workflows must be updated to reflect the new binary names and usage patterns.

## Code Samples

Below are minimal examples that highlight the key differences in compilation and execution between AFL 2.52b and AFL++.

> [!NOTE]  
> For full implementation details and rationale, refer to the [technical spike on transitioning to AFL++.](https://github.com/sysec-uic/AutoPatch-LLM/blob/main/docs/TechnicalSpikes/004.afl2.52b-to-afl%2B%2B-technical-spike.md)




### Building and Running Example with AFL 2.52b

```bash
# Compile using AFL 2.52b's instrumentation
/path/to/afl-2.52b/afl-gcc -o vuln vuln.c

# Create input and output directories
mkdir input output
echo "my seed" > input/seed.txt

# Run the fuzzer
/path/to/afl-2.52b/afl-fuzz -i input -o output -- ./vuln
```



### Building and Running Example with AFL++

```bash
# Compile using AFL++ 
afl-clang-fast -o vuln vuln.c

# Create input and output directories
mkdir input output
echo "my seed" > input/seed.txt

# Run the fuzzer
afl-fuzz -i input -o output -- ./vuln
```

---

### Key Difference

- AFL++ uses `afl-clang-fast` instead of `afl-gcc`

The rest of the workflow remains nearly identical.

## Comparison of Options

### AFL++
AFL++ is the actively maintained and community-supported successor of AFL 2.52b. It retains compatibility while introducing modern features such as persistent mode, QEMU support, and enhanced instrumentation. It is now the default afl package in many distributions.

**Pros:**
- **Active Development:** Continuously updated with performance, usability, and security improvements  
- **Backward-Compatible:** Works with existing AFL fuzz targets with minimal changes  
- **Advanced Features:** Supports persistent mode, grammar-based fuzzing, LTO, custom mutators  
- **Ease of Setup:** Available via popular package managers (`apt`,  etc.)

**Cons:**
- **Tooling Adjustments:** Requires switching to `afl-clang-fast` and updating scripts  
- **Learning Curve:** Some advanced features require additional configuration or knowledge



### Alternative Fuzzers 
These are other standalone fuzzing engines that offer different fuzzing models and tight integration with modern toolchains (e.g., LLVM).

**Pros:**
- **LLVM Integration:** Especially strong for LibFuzzer + sanitizer workflows  
- **Fuzzing Variety:** Broader support for edge-case inputs and custom coverage models  
- **Lightweight:** Often easier to embed directly into test cases

**Cons:**
- **Incompatibility:** Would require rewriting fuzz targets from scratch  
- **Fragmentation:** Adds maintenance overhead to support multiple fuzzers  
- **Weaker Ecosystem Integration:** Lacks the deep integration AFL has in some existing tools



### FuzzBench for Evaluation
FuzzBench is a benchmarking platform for evaluating fuzzers like AFL, AFL++, LibFuzzer, and others using standardized experiments.

**Pros:**
- **Performance Insight:** Offers reproducible comparisons on open-source targets  
- **Fuzzer-independent:** Supports AFL++, AFL, LibFuzzer, Honggfuzz, etc.  
- **Custom Experiments:** Enables in-house targets to be evaluated over time

**Cons:**
- **Not a Fuzzer:** Cannot be used for production fuzzing (only benchmarking)
- **Integration Overhead:** Requires Docker-based setup and CI-style workflows  
- **Limited Scope:** Valuable for evaluation, but not suitable for day-to-day fuzzing


---

## Conclusion

The migration to AFL++ gives us a stable and actively supported path forward. It works with our existing AFL 2.52b setup and only needs minor changes in build and execution commands, as demonstrated through the technical spike. Using an actively maintained tool keeps our fuzzing reliable and up to date with modern features.
