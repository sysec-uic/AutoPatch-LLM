## Spike: OSS-Fuzz Integration
Conducted by: Lily Leith, lleit@uic.edu
Backlog Work Item: #128
Sprint: 4/28/25

## Goal
After conducting this spike, we should know the following about the oss-fuzz procedure:

- The encoding used for the crash inputs.
- Any logging of the crash signal.
- The context provided by standard error and the stack trace.
- How oss-fuzz builds the fuzzers from the local checkout of the buggy library.

That information will help answer the following questions:

1. How would crash inputs need to be manipulated to form CrashDetail objects?
2. What parts of the standard error and stack trace are redundant given the CPG component? Are there any parts included in the standard error and stack trace that could be parsed for utilization in LLM-dispatch context?
3. What is the best method for invoking buggy programs from oss-fuzz within the existing fuzzing service?

## Method
Explore oss-fuzz tools by building fuzzers of buggy libraries/codebases, run the fuzzers, examine the inputs, and log the results.

## Evidence
Document the evidence collected that informed the conclusions below. Examples may include:

Recorded or live demos of a prototype providing the desired capabilities
Metrics collected while testing the prototype
Documentation that indicates the solution can provided the desired capabilities

## Conclusions
What was the answer to the question(s) outlined at the start of the spike? Capture what was learned that will inform future work.

## Next Steps
What work is expected as an outcome of the learning within this spike. Was there work that was blocked or dependent on the learning within this spike?
