## Spike: OSS-Fuzz Technical Spike
Conducted by: Xiaoguang Wang (xgwang9@uic.edu).
Backlog Work Item: [Github Issue #42](https://github.com/sysec-uic/AutoPatch-LLM/issues/42).

## Goal
We have a working prototype to test small buggy programs from fuzzer tutorials, such as [afl-training](https://github.com/mykter/afl-training). But we need to test if AutoPatch-LLM can work well for real-world programs and bugs.

## Method
We tried to setup Google's [fuzzbench](https://github.com/google/fuzzbench) and collect bugs. Document of setting up fuzzbench is [here](https://github.com/sysec-uic/AutoPatch-LLM/blob/main/docs/FuzzBench.md). We got crashes for 2 programs in fuzzebench, but we had difficulties to re-produce the crash. So we decided to use [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) to collect bugs. OSS-Fuzz is a continuous fuzzing service for open source projects.

## Evidence
OSS-Fuzz provides a website reporting bugs found for ~1000 open source projects.
We can find bug reports for [libpng](https://issues.oss-fuzz.com/issues?q=libpng). For example, here is a bug found recently: https://issues.oss-fuzz.com/issues/42515068. It seems they also provided the reproducer testcase.

## Conclusions
We tried to use fuzzbench but got blocked because of difficulties to re-produce the crash. So we decided to use OSS-Fuzz to collect bugs. It seems that OSS-Fuzz is a good source for real-world bugs. We can use it to test our AutoPatch-LLM.

## Next Steps
We need to get real-world bugs from OSS-Fuzz and use them to test our AutoPatch-LLM.
We may need to write a script to download the bugs from OSS-Fuzz and run them against our AutoPatch-LLM.
