## Spike: OSS-Fuzz
Conducted by: Lily Leith lleit@uic.edu
Backlog Work Item: #56
Sprint: ?

## Goal
We have previously considered using FuzzBench to source the real world CVEs for evaluation of AutoPatch. The feasibility of using FuzzBench is outlined in technical spike 002. To explore more CVE sources, we outline using OSS-Fuzz, a platform in which open source bugs and vulnerabilities are logged after being discovered by fuzzing tools.

## Method
- Read OSS-Fuzz documentation.
- Crawl OSS-Fuzz for CVEs and attempt to reproduce them: describe this process in terms of time, accessibility, system requirements, etc.

## Evidence


## Conclusions


## Next Steps
