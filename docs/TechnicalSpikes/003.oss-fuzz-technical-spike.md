## Spike: OSS-Fuzz
Conducted by: Lily Leith lleit@uic.edu
Backlog Work Item: [sysec-uic/AutoPatch-LLM#56](https://github.com/sysec-uic/AutoPatch-LLM/issues/56)
Sprint: 

## Goal
Previously, we explored using FuzzBench to source real-world CVEs for evaluation of AutoPatch. As outlined in spike 002, FuzzBench is likely infeasible for this purpose. We now explore use of OSS-Fuzz, an platform that logs open source bugs and vulnerabilities that have been discovered via fuzzing. Specifically, we are interested in the time and system requirements for using OSS-Fuzz CVEs.

## Method
- Read OSS-Fuzz documentation.
- Crawl the platform for CVEs of interest: outline the method used to reproduce, its accessibility, etc.
