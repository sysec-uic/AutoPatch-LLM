Conducted by: Arushi
Backlog Work Item: {Link to the work item to provide more context}
Sprint: {Which sprint did the study take place. Include sprint start date}

## Goal
Investigate what is needed to move from AFL2.52b to AFL++ for the fuzzing component

## Method
Describe how the team will uncover the answer to the question(s) the spike intends to answer. For example:

Build prototype to test.
Research existing documents and samples.
Discuss with subject matter experts.

## Evidence
Document the evidence collected that informed the conclusions below. Examples may include:

Recorded or live demos of a prototype providing the desired capabilities
Metrics collected while testing the prototype
Documentation that indicates the solution can provided the desired capabilities

## Conclusions
What was the answer to the question(s) outlined at the start of the spike? Capture what was learned that will inform future work.

## Next Steps
What work is expected as an outcome of the learning within this spike. Was there work that was blocked or dependent on the learning within this spike?
