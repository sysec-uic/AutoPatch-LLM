The following is a list of issues you may face when running afl.

Some issues will be noticed when running the main.py script when prompted with this error message:
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'output_vulnerable/crashes/'
No output crashes folder found. It is likely that the fuzz command did not execute correctly. Please go to docs/common_afl_issues.txt for help.

Other issues may be clear if the program (specifically the fuzzer part) run for a much shorter amount of time than indicated in the timeout. This 
is often accompanied by the fuzzer saying that it found no crashes. In either of these cases as well as when you recieve the no output folder error 
message, proceed with the following:

To diagnose the issue, go to the command_log directory, find the file for the program target, and first try running the fuzzer compile command.
If the output is:

1. something like this: zsh: no such file or directory: ../afl-2.52b/afl-gcc
This indicates that you have not set up afl. Please go to the afl-2.52b directory and run make. If you experience any build issues, refer to their 
documentation. When you run make, you will see an output line that looks like this: 

unset AFL_USE_ASAN AFL_USE_MSAN; AFL_QUIET=1 AFL_INST_RATIO=100 AFL_PATH=. ./afl-gcc -O3 .....
The text following AFL_PATH indicates the compiler that afl has chosen based on your system. Ensure that the afl_compiler_path setting in the 
top of main indicates a path leading to the compiler. 

2. something like this: [-] PROGRAM ABORT : Incorrect use (not called through afl-gcc?)
this indicates that there is a mismatch in the compiler path listed in the top of main.py vs. the compiler that afl has 
chosen based on your system. perform make clean in the afl folder and go to option 1 to see the correct compiler to use.
 
3. nothing out of the ordinary happens/you get the normal message indicating any warnings.
If this happens, proceed to the next step.

Step 2: run the fuzzer command from the command command_log in the command line.

The following things might happen:

1. if you get a message that looks something like this:

NOTE: it's important to run the rm-temp-dirs task from the taskfile in between runs. If you don't remove the output directories from a 
particular run, you could have issues with the fuzzer that you don't notice. Eventually error detection in afl will be automatically noticed/handled.
