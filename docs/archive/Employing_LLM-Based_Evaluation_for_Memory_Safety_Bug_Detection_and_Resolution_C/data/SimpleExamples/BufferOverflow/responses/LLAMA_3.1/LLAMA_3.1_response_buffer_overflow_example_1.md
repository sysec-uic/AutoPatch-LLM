buffer_overflow_example_1.c

The provided code is written in C and is used for a simple password verification system. However, there are several memory-related errors and potential security vulnerabilities present in the code.

Buffer Overflow Vulnerability: The `scanf` function is used to read user input into the input array. However, if the user enters a string longer than 7 characters, it will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to undefined behavior or a segmentation fault. To fix this, you can use the `fgets` function instead, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read.

```c
fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
```

However, `fgets` includes the newline character in the string, so you may want to remove it:

```c
input[strcspn(input, "\n")] = 0;
```

Potential Buffer Overflow in `sscanf`: The `sscanf` function is used to read the password from the `PASSWORD_FILE` string. However, if the password is longer than 7 characters, it will also cause a buffer overflow. To fix this, you can specify the maximum number of characters to read in the format string:

```c
sscanf(PASSWORD_FILE, "%7s", password);
```

3. Missing Error Checking:
   The `sscanf` and `scanf` functions return the number of successful assignments, which should be checked to ensure that the input was parsed correctly.

```c
if (sscanf(PASSWORD_FILE, "%7s", password) != 1) {
    // Handle error
}

if (fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin) == NULL) {
    // Handle error
}
```

Use of `strncmp`: The `strncmp` function is used to compare the input password with the stored password. However, it only compares the first 8 characters, which may not be the entire password. To fix this, you can use the `strcmp` function instead, which compares the entire string.

```c
if (strcmp(password, input) == 0)
```

5. Hardcoded Password:
   The password is hardcoded in the `PASSWORD_FILE` string, which is a security risk. In a real-world application, passwords should be stored securely, such as hashed and salted.

Here's the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

const char *PASSWORD_FILE = "cs487";

int main()
{
    char input[8];
    char password[8];

    // Read the password from the PASSWORD_FILE string (simulated here with sscanf)
    if (sscanf(PASSWORD_FILE, "%7s", password) != 1) {
        printf("Error reading password\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Prompt for the password
    printf("Enter password: ");
    if (fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin) == NULL) {
        printf("Error reading input\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Remove newline character
    input[strcspn(input, "\n")] = 0;

    // Check if the entered password matches
    if (strcmp(password, input) == 0)
        printf("Access granted\n");
    else
        printf("Access denied\n");

    return 0;
}
```
