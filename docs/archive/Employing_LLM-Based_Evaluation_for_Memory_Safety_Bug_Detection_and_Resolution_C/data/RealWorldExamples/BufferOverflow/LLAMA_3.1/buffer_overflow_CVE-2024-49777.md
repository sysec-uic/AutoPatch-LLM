# Memory-Related Issues in the Provided Code

## Memory Leak

The `demuxer` object is dynamically allocated using `new` but never deallocated. This can cause a memory leak. To fix this, consider using a smart pointer like `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` to manage the memory automatically.

Original code:

```cpp
AbstractDemuxer* demuxer = new MatroskaDemuxer(readManager);
```

Updated code:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<AbstractDemuxer> demuxer = std::make_unique<MatroskaDemuxer>(readManager);
```

## Buffer Overflow

The code does not check the bounds of the `argv` array before accessing its elements. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the user provides too few command-line arguments. To fix this, add a check to ensure that `argc` is at least 2 before accessing `argv[1]`.

Original code:

```cpp
string fileName = argv[1];
```

Updated code:

```cpp
if (argc < 2) {
    // Handle the error, e.g., print an error message and exit
}
string fileName = argv[1];
```

## Use-After-Free

The code does not check if the `demuxer` object is successfully created before using it. If the creation fails, using the `demuxer` pointer can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. To fix this, add a check to ensure that the `demuxer` object is not null before using it.

Original code:

```cpp
demuxer->openFile(fileName);
```

Updated code:

```cpp
if (demuxer) {
    demuxer->openFile(fileName);
} else {
    // Handle the error, e.g., print an error message and exit
}
```

## Discussion on Memory Safety in C++

It's worth noting that C++ is not memory-safe by default. However, there are efforts to improve memory safety in C++ through the use of lifetime annotations and other techniques.
