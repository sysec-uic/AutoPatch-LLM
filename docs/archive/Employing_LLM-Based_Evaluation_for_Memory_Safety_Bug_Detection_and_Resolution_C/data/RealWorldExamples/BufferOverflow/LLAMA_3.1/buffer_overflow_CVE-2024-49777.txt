Based on the provided code, I've identified potential memory-related issues:

Memory Leak: The demuxer object is dynamically allocated using new but never deallocated. This can cause a memory leak. To fix this, consider using a smart pointer like unique_ptr or shared_ptr to manage the memory automatically.

AbstractDemuxer* demuxer = new MatroskaDemuxer(readManager);

Should be replaced with:

    ```cpp
std::unique_ptr<AbstractDemuxer> demuxer = std::make_unique<MatroskaDemuxer>(readManager);

Buffer Overflow: The code does not check the bounds of the argv array before accessing its elements. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the user provides too few command-line arguments. To fix this, add a check to ensure that argc is at least 2 before accessing argv[1].

string fileName = argv[1];

Should be replaced with:

    ```cpp
if (argc < 2) {
    // Handle the error, e.g., print an error message and exit
}
string fileName = argv[1];

Use-After-Free: The code does not check if the demuxer object is successfully created before using it. If the creation fails, using the demuxer pointer can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. To fix this, add a check to ensure that the demuxer object is not null before using it.

demuxer->openFile(fileName);

Should be replaced with:

    ```cpp
if (demuxer) {
    demuxer->openFile(fileName);
} else {
    // Handle the error, e.g., print an error message and exit
}

As for the general discussion on memory safety in C++, it's worth noting that the language is not memory-safe by default 5. However, there are efforts to improve memory safety in C++ through the use of lifetime annotations 4 and other techniques.
