The provided code is written in C and handles memory allocation for image data. Upon reviewing the code, I have identified a potential integer overflow vulnerability.

The issue lies in the calculation of stride_in_bytes (line 113):

stride_in_bytes = s * bit_depth / 8;

Here, s is a 32-bit integer variable, and bit_depth is also an integer. If the product of s and bit_depth exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a 32-bit integer, an integer overflow will occur, resulting in a smaller value being assigned to stride_in_bytes. This can lead to a buffer overflow when allocating memory for the image data.

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to use 64-bit integers for calculations that may result in large values. In this case, you can cast s and bit_depth to uint64_t before performing the multiplication:

stride_in_bytes = (uint64_t)s * bit_depth / 8;

Additionally, it is a good practice to check for integer overflows when performing calculations that may result in large values. You can use techniques such as those described in 1 to detect integer overflows.

Regarding double free occurrences and use-after-free vulnerabilities, the provided code does not seem to have any obvious issues. However, it is essential to ensure that the alloc_cb function (if used) properly handles memory deallocation to avoid double free errors.

To ensure safe memory allocation, access, and deallocation, it is recommended to:

Use 64-bit integers for calculations that may result in large values.
Check for integer overflows when performing calculations.
Verify that the alloc_cb function (if used) properly handles memory deallocation.
Use memory debugging tools to detect potential memory-related issues.
