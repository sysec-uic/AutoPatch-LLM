# Analysis of Memory Safety in Python Code

The provided Python code does not directly contain memory-related errors such as buffer overflows, double free occurrences, or use-after-free vulnerabilities. This is because Python, as a high-level language, manages memory internally and provides a layer of abstraction that protects against common memory safety issues.

## Potential Issues to Consider

1. **Data Size**  
   In the `poc` function, a large string of 2000 'A' characters is created. While Python can handle this without memory issues, it's essential to be mindful of data sizes when working with large inputs to avoid potential memory exhaustion.

2. **External Library Usage**  
   The code uses the `requests` library, which is a Python library and therefore also benefits from Python's memory safety features. However, when using external libraries, it's crucial to ensure they are well-maintained and do not introduce memory safety issues.
