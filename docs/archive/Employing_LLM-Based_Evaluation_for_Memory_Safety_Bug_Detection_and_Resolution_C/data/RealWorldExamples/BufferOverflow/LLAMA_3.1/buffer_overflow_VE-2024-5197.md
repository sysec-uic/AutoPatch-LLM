The provided code is written in C and handles memory allocation for image data. Upon reviewing the code, I have identified a potential integer overflow vulnerability.

The issue lies in the calculation of `stride_in_bytes` (line 113):

```c
stride_in_bytes = s * bit_depth / 8;
```

Here, `s` is a 32-bit integer variable, and `bit_depth` is also an integer. If the product of `s` and `bit_depth` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a 32-bit integer, an integer overflow will occur, resulting in a smaller value being assigned to `stride_in_bytes`. This can lead to a buffer overflow when allocating memory for the image data.

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to use 64-bit integers for calculations that may result in large values. In this case, you can cast `s` and `bit_depth` to `uint64_t` before performing the multiplication:

```c
stride_in_bytes = (uint64_t)s * bit_depth / 8;
```

Additionally, it is a good practice to check for integer overflows when performing calculations that may result in large values. You can use techniques such as those described in [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-for-integer-overflow/).

### Recommendations:
- Use 64-bit integers for calculations that may result in large values.
- Check for integer overflows when performing calculations.
- Verify that the `alloc_cb` function (if used) properly handles memory deallocation.
- Use memory debugging tools to detect potential memory-related issues.
