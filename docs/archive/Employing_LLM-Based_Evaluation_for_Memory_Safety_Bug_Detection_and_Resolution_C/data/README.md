This folder is to be used to organize data that is output from a given LLM.

The text files are the RAW OUTPUT from the LLMs, the Markdown files are edited for readability when rendered.

Use folder name and filname structure that clearly conveys the LLM, System, and User prompt combination.  For example

`data/SimpleExamples/BufferOverflow/prompts/`

`data/SimpleExamples/BufferOverflow/responses/ChatGPT4o/`


Use markdown format to and always include screenshots, always include the version number of the LLM and a timestamp of when the data was gathered.
