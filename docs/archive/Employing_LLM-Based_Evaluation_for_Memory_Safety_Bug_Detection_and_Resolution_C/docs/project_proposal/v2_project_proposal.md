### Software Project Proposal: **Automated LLM Evaluation for Identifying Memory Safety Bugs in C**

---

#### **Project Title:**  
**LLM-Based Bug Detection and Fixing System for Memory Safety in C Programming**

---

#### **Objective:**  
The goal of this project is to design and implement a system to evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs) in their ability to automatically identify and suggest fixes for memory safety bugs in C programs. The system will utilize several types of common memory safety vulnerabilities and evaluate LLM performance based on specific metrics. Additionally, the system architecture will incorporate fuzzing techniques and sanitizers to generate buggy code and provide test cases for verifying the correctness of the LLM-generated fixes.

---

#### **Scope of the Project:**  
This project will focus on testing two to three types of memory safety bugs and measure the ability of different LLMs to detect these issues and provide adequate solutions. The types of memory safety bugs that will be addressed include:

1. **Buffer Overflow**  
   A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, leading to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.

2. **Use-After-Free**  
   This bug occurs when a program continues to use a pointer to memory that has already been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and security risks.

3. **Double Free**  
   A double free occurs when a program attempts to free a block of memory more than once, leading to memory corruption or crashes.

---

#### **System Overview:**

The system architecture will be as follows (based on the diagram provided):

1. **Large Open-Source Codebase**  
   The project will use a large open-source code repository as the basis for detecting memory safety bugs. This codebase will contain a variety of C programs with embedded or naturally occurring memory safety vulnerabilities.

2. **Fuzzer and Sanitizers**  
   A fuzzer, in combination with tools like AddressSanitizer, will be used to explore edge cases in the code and intentionally generate memory safety bugs. The fuzzer will stress-test the code by providing unexpected or malformed input data. AddressSanitizer will help identify and log memory-related issues, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors.

3. **Bug Log and Test Case Generation**  
   The fuzzer will generate both a **Bug Log** and a set of **Test Cases**. The Bug Log will document all the detected memory safety vulnerabilities, while the test cases will serve as inputs to verify the correctness of the LLM-patched code.

4. **LLM Integration**  
   Two or more LLMs (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT, Meta’s LLaMA) will be integrated into the system. Each LLM will receive buggy code as input and generate suggested patches for the identified memory safety bugs.

5. **Patch Verification**  
   After the LLMs provide their suggested patches, the system will automatically apply these patches and run the test cases to verify the correctness of the fix. The **Patch Verify** step ensures that the fixes are valid, with any failed fixes being looped back to the LLM for further refinement.

6. **Final Verification**  
   The system will check if the patches provided by the LLM pass all the test cases. If successful, the patched code will be verified and considered correct. If unsuccessful, the system will prompt further iterations of bug fixing.

#### **Evaluation Metrics:**  
To assess the performance of the LLMs in identifying and fixing memory safety bugs, the following metrics will be used:

1. **Accuracy**  
   - **Bug Detection Rate**: The percentage of identified memory safety bugs versus the actual number of bugs present in the code.
   - **False Positives**: Instances where the LLM incorrectly identifies safe code as containing bugs.

2. **Solution Quality**  
   - **Correctness of Fixes**: The percentage of correct fixes suggested for identified bugs.
   - **Improvement in Code Safety**: The degree to which the LLM's suggestion improves the memory safety of the program.

3. **Execution Performance**  
   - **Latency**: Time taken by the LLM to analyze the code and provide suggestions.
   - **Resource Utilization**: Memory and computational resources consumed by the LLM during the evaluation.

4. **Comprehensibility**  
   - **Clarity of Fixes**: How understandable and implementable the suggested fixes are for developers.
   - **Explanatory Quality**: How well the LLM explains the bug and its solution.

5. **Patch Verification Success Rate**  
   - **Test Case Pass Rate**: The percentage of test cases that the patched code passes after applying the LLM-suggested fix.
   - **Iteration Efficiency**: The number of times the LLM has to modify its initial patch before it passes all test cases.

#### **Conclusion:**  
This project aims to develop a system that can help evaluate and compare the performance of different LLMs in identifying and fixing memory safety issues in C code. By incorporating fuzzers, sanitizers, and LLM-powered bug detection and repair, this system will enable automated evaluation of LLM capabilities while also improving the safety and robustness of C programs. The detailed performance metrics will provide insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs for software debugging in real-world scenarios.

This enriched proposal includes a robust architecture for bug detection and repair, enhanced by fuzzer-generated test cases and automated patch verification, ensuring that the system can comprehensively evaluate LLM performance.
