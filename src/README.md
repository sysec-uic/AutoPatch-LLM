# For fastest and easiest development, try out the devcontainer

If you are running inside a dev container, use the file at `/.devcontainer/devcontainer.env.example` file to easily store your secret variables such as your OPEN_API_KEY.

The devcontainer is optional, if you do not want to use the devcontainer, use the `.env.example` file to easily store your secret variables such as your OPEN_API_KEY.

Rename either file without the `.example` suffix.
- If using the devcontainer, rebuild the devcontainer!
- If not using the devcontainer, from the root of the project dir, source the file: `. .env`, this afters your shells environment.
