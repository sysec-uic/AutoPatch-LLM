Example1:
Password Authentication Program
Overview
This program prompts the user to enter a password and checks it against a predefined password ("cs487").
If the entered password matches, it outputs "Access granted"; otherwise, it displays "Access denied."

Example2:
Lowercase Copy Program
Overview
This program takes an input string, converts all uppercase letters to lowercase, and outputs the modified string. 
It uses a temporary buffer to store the converted string, then duplicates it for output.

Example3:
PNG Chunk Processing Program
Overview
This program simulates the handling of a PNG image's tRNS (transparency) chunk, checking if a palette is loaded before processing and issuing warnings for any issues.
It reads CRC data into a buffer, though it lacks bounds checking, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow.
